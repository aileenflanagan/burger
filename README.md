# Burger
    Burger is full stack application that allows the client to add burgers and devour them. This communicates with the back end which stores the information in the database. 

## How It Works
    * User can add the burger by typing in a burger name, and then clicking add burger. 
    * The burger will then show up on the burger list, which lists the id and name of the burger on the left.
    * There is a button next to each of the burgers on the burger list, which says devour.
    * If the user clicks "Devour It!" the burger will then move to the Devoured Burgers list. 

## Installation
    npm install
    npm install mysql
    npm install express

## Future Improvements
    * Was unable to get the picture of the burger to show up, was only showing the alt text so I would like to get that to show up.
    * Add more styling to the page.
